A little bit of salt, little bit of turmeric
A bit of oil sprayed on so that the fish doesnt stick
With a knife make slits along the sides of the fish
Rub in the turmeric, salt, wait as long as you wish(15 minutes to overnight)
Grease a grilling rack
Spray some oil on the fish, front and back(1 tsp)
Your microwave mode is what you need to crack
Before you turn up the heat
A combination of modes -microwave and grill 
30-70(30% microwave ,70% grill) is what fits the bill
10 minutes for each side is the drill
And you have a treat! 

(Now simply put green beans ,winter veggies roast and tomatoes along with the pomfret and enjoy!)
